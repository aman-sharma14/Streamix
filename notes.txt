Spring : Java with a manager
    Creates objects for you
    Connects classes automatically
    Handles web requests (HTTP)
    Manages databases, security, config, etc.

spring boot is spring that is faster to start, less config, prod-ready

Microservices : Instead of one giant app, you build many small apps.
    as monolith is bad for scaling
    each service has its own - spring boot app, db, runs on own port, talks to others via rest
